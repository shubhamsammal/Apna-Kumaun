    <h3 class="newpage-head">HISTORY</h3>
    <p class="newpage-para">The name Mussoorie is often attributed to a derivation of mansūr, a shrub which is
        indigenous to the area. The
        town is
        often referred to as Mansuri by Indians.<br><br>

        In 1803 the Gorkhas under Umer Singh Thapa conquered the Garhwal and the Dehra, whereby Mussoorie was
        established. On 1
        November 1814, a war broke out between the Gorkhas and the British. Dehradun and Mussoorie were evacuated by the
        Gorkhas
        by the year 1815 and were annexed to the district of Saharanpur by 1819.<br><br>

        Mussoorie as a resort was established in 1825 by Captain Young, a British military officer. With Mr Shore, the
        resident
        Superintendent of Revenues at Dehradun, he explored the present site and jointly constructed a shooting
        lodge.[6] Lt.
        Frederick Young of the East India Company came to Mussoorie to shoot game.[citation needed] He built a hunting
        lodge
        (shooting box) on the Camel's Back Road, and became a magistrate of Doon in 1823. He raised the first Gurkha
        Regiment
        and planted the first potatoes in the valley. His tenure in Mussoorie ended in 1844, after which he served in
        Dimapur
        and Darjeeling, later retiring as a General and returning to Ireland.[citation needed] There are no memorials to
        commemorate Young in Mussoorie. However, there is a Young Road in Dehradun on which ONGC's Tel
        Bhawan[clarification
        needed] stands.[citation needed]

    <h3 class="newpage-head">DEMOGRAPHICS</h3>
    <p class="newpage-para">As of 2011 India census,[16] Mussoorie had a population of 30,118. Males constitute 55% of
        the population and
        females
        45%. Mussoorie has an average literacy rate of 89%, higher than the national average of 75%: male literacy is
        94%, and
        female literacy is 84%.<br><br> In Mussoorie, 9% of the population is under 6 years of age. In Mussoorie Nagar
        Palika
        Parishad,
        female sex ratio is of 812 against the state average of 963. Moreover, the child sex ratio in Mussoorie is
        around 918
        compared to Uttarakhand state average of 890.
    </p>
    <h3 class="newpage-head">Economy</h3>
    <p class="newpage-para">
        The economy in Mussoorie is primarily dependent on tourism. Tourists come primarily from New Delhi, Punjab,
        Haryana and
        other northern states. In Mussoorie itself, there were 2,794,108 domestic tourist arrivals and 1865 foreign
        arrivals in
        2017.[24] There is a projected 58.5% growth forecast in foreign tourist arrivals due to EVisa
        nationally.<br><br>
        Educational institutions are another contributor to the local economy. The Uttarakhand Government has created
        investment
        proposals for the development of a mountain forest resort and a development of ropeways in order to boost
        tourism in the
        region. The ropeway which was inaugurated on 6 March 2019 is being built at a cost of ₹3 billion (US$42 million)
        and is
        expected to be completed by 2022.
    </p>
    <h3 class="newpage-head">Transport</h3>
    <p class="newpage-para">
        Mussoorie is connected by road to Delhi and major cities. It is called the "Gateway" to Yamunotri and Gangotri
        shrines
        of Northern India.[27] The nearest Airport Jolly Grant in Dehradun is 60 km (37 mi) away from the city[28] The
        closest
        rail station is Dehradun. Within Mussoorie are taxis and buses. A ropeway between Purkul Gaon, Dehradun and
        Mussoorie is
        in the works.[26] This rope way is projected to reduce traffic congestion and increase tourist footfall to
        Mussoorie.
